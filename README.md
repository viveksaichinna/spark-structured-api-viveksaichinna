## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Project Structure**

Ensure your directory looks like this:

MusicListeningAnalysis/
├── input/
│   ├── listening_logs.csv
│   └── songs_metadata.csv
├── output/
│   ├── user_favorite_genres/
│   ├── avg_listen_time_per_song/
│   ├── top_songs_this_week/
│   ├── happy_recommendations/
│   ├── genre_loyalty_scores/
│   └── night_owl_users/
├── music_analysis.py
└── README.md

---

### **2. Running the Script**

You can run your analysis using the Spark CLI:

#### **a. Navigate to your project directory**

```bash
cd MusicListeningAnalysis/

Run your PySpark script

spark-submit music_analysis.py

Verify Outputs

Check your results using:

ls output/


Overview

This project uses Spark Structured APIs to analyze music listening behavior and trends from a fictional streaming platform. You’ll explore user preferences, song popularity, and engagement patterns using two input datasets.

Objectives

By completing this assignment, you’ll practice:
	1.	Reading structured data using PySpark
	2.	Performing joins and aggregations
	3.	Generating insights with filtering, grouping, and ranking
	4.	Writing results to CSV files using .write.option("header", True).csv(...)

Assignment Tasks

1. User’s Favorite Genre

Objective:
Identify each user’s favorite genre by counting how many times they played songs from each genre.

Expected Output:
Directory user_favorite_genres/ with most listened genre per user.

⸻

2. Average Listen Time per Song

Objective:
Calculate average play duration for each song using listening logs.

Expected Output:
Directory avg_listen_time_per_song/ with song-wise average durations.

⸻

3. Top 10 Most Played Songs This Week

Objective:
Get the 10 most played songs in the last 7 days.

Expected Output:
Directory top_songs_this_week/ with top 10 songs and play counts.

⸻

4. Recommend “Happy” Songs to Sad Listeners

Objective:
Find users who mostly listen to “Sad” songs and recommend up to 3 new “Happy” songs they haven’t played.

Expected Output:
Directory happy_recommendations/ with user_id and recommended songs.

5. Genre Loyalty Score

Objective:
Compute the ratio of plays in a user’s most listened genre. Return users with a loyalty score > 0.8.

Expected Output:
Directory genre_loyalty_scores/ with user_id, genre, and score.

⸻

6. Night Owl Users

Objective:
Identify users who frequently listen to music between 12:00 AM and 5:00 AM.

Expected Output:
Directory night_owl_users/ with user_id of late-night listeners.
